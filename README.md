# Welcome to Angel's GitHub Profile! 👋

## About Me
I am a passionate computational engineering student at "Tecnológico de Monterrey", currently in my fourth semester. At 19 years old, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and contributing to the programming community.

## Learning Objective 🎯
My main goal here is to absorb as much knowledge as I can about programming. I'm enthusiastic about diving into different languages, exploring various frameworks, and understanding the magic behind the code. Through this GitHub space, I hope to document my learning process and connect with fellow learners and experienced developers.

## How to Connect 🐸
